# - Build a linked list node that contains the word and its definition
# (and anything else you need) using a Struct (not a class). [ok]
# - Build a basic linked list class that allows you to:
#   1. Create the list [ok]
#   2. Read nodes at a particular index (add a printout which tracks the
#   crawler's progress or at least returns the number of steps). In the
#   comments, state the Big-O time of this operation.
#   3. Insert nodes at a particular index or, separately, at the end of
#   the list (so store a reference to the last node). In the comments,
#   state the Big-O time of this operation.
# - Build a method #reverse on your LinkedList class that will entirely
# flip the order of this list, so the "head" and the "tail" are swapped
# and all the links point in opposite directions.
# - In a comment above the method, explain how quickly it runs in Big O
# notation. Is it "in place" (you reused the existing nodes), or did you
# have to create new nodes to replace the old ones?

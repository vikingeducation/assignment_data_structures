# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Authors: Hannah and Vishal.

---------------------------

Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

1. O(1)
2. O(n), because adding an element to the beginning of an array results in
   reconstructing a new array.
3. O(n), for the same reason as above.
4. O(n).
5. O(n).
6. O(n).
7. O(n).
8. O(n).
9. O(n).
10. O(1).
11. O(n).

# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Chad Lucas

Warmup: Big O

1. Accessing an item by index in an array.

Constant time O(1), finds item by simple addition and multiplication to find value. It's independent of data size.

2. Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array.

Linear time O(n), due to the fact you have to rebuild the entire data set again without the value selected for deletion because arrays are continous chunks of memory.

3. Pushing an item onto the end of an array.

Linear time O(n), same as unshifting a new array is created in memory to add new value. 

4. Upcasing a string

Linear time O(n), you have to iterate through each char in the string and put each char into new array.

5. Reversing a string

Linear time O(n), iterate through array and pop each char and push into new array

6. Enumerable#each method

Linear time O(n), iterates through each element in array

7. Enumerable#include? method

Linear time O(n), iterates through "each" element and checks condition

8. Finding the max of an array
Linear time 0(n), you need to check every element to see if it is the new maximum value

9. Linear time O(n), you have to iterate through each char in string.

10. Inserting value to a Hash
Constant time O(1)

11. Retrieving the keys of a Hash
Constant time O(1)

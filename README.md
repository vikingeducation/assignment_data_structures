# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Julia Herron, Thomas Lo

Warmup Big O

1. O(1) only one operation to calculate the index position, every item is the same size

2. O(n) Deleting from the array will require you to create a new array.

3. O(n) Adding to an array will require you to create a new array.

4. O(n) N is length of the string.

5. O(n) is worst case since you go through each element; O(n/2) Half of the length of the string, if reversing in place.

6. O(n) N is the range of the enumerable.

7. O(n) Because you'll have to check through n amount of items for the worst case.

8. O(n) Because you'll have to check through n amount of items for the worst case.

9. O(n) Because you'll have to evaluate the whole string before splitting.

10. O(1) Find the bucket, then go through the linked list. Constant time in relation to the size of the data.

11. O(n) For worst case, but should be O(1) if it's a balanced hash.

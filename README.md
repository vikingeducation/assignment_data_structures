# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)


Accessing an item by index in an array
  O(1) because every element has the same number of bytes.
  Starting place + byte_per_element * index.

Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
  There may not be space before start of array, so a whole new array must be created.
  O(n) where n increases with the size of the array be recreated.

Pushing an item onto the end of an array
  There may not be space after end of array, so a whole new array must be created.
  O(n) where n increases with the size of the array be recreated.

Upcasing a String
  Must iterate over every character.
  O(n) where n increases with the length of the string.

Reversing a String
  Must iterate over every character.
  Uses a stack to store characters backwards.
  O(2n), reduced to O(n) where n increases with the length of the string.

The Enumerable#each method
  Must iterate over every element.
  Assuming the block passsed in is a constant operation.
  O(n) where n increases with the number of elements.

The Enumerable#include? method
  If implemented using iteration: O(n) where n icreases with the number of elements.
  If implemented using binary search: O(log n) where n icreases linearly as the number of elements increases polynomially.

Finding the max of an array
  Assume array is not sorted.
  Must iterate through entire array.
  O(n) where n increases with the length of the array.

Splitting a String
  Count the length of the string and create an empty array of that length.
  Iterate over every element and insert it into the array.
  O(n) where n increases with the length of the string.

Inserting a value to a Hash
  Assume a well-balanced hash
  Run input thru hash function
  Locate index of associative array based on hashed input
  Prepend new value to head of linked list
  O(1) because no iteration over array or linked list occurs

Retrieving the keys of a Hash ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
  Assuming keys aren't stored, only hashed keys are stored
  Iterate over every array bucket
  Within every bucket, iterate over the values of the linked list
  Return unhashed version of values
  O(n) with a large coefficient, n is a static number of linked lists with nodes increasing

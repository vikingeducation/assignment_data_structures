Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Alexa, Sampson, and James

Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

Accessing an item by index in an array: O(1)
Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array: O(n)
Pushing an item onto the end of an array: O(n)
Upcasing a String: O(n)
Reversing a String: O(2n)
The Enumerable#each method: O(n)
The Enumerable#include? method: O(n)
Finding the max of an array: O(n)
splitting a String: O(n)
Inserting a value to a Hash: O(1)
Retrieving the keys of a Hash ({ foo: "bar" }.keys): O(n)

Big O

1. O(1), since you only need to perform a single multiplication and/or addition

2. O(n), since you need to re-write the new longer array.

3. O(n), same, you need to re-write the new longer array.

4. O(n), since you need to access each character of the string and perform the operation.

5. O(n), since you need to read the first string from the back and write the new one (2n)

6. O(n), since you need to access each element (n) and then perform the operation (c).

7. O(n), since you need to read through the array and compare for a match on each one.

8. O(n), since you need to read through the array and compare each element to your current max value.

9. O(n), since you need to read through the string (n) and write an array with those elements when you come to a break char (+n)

10. O(1), since you just need to run the hash function and change the value assigned to a key.

11. O(n), since you need to read through the array of keys and then reading each one.

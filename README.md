# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)


1. O(1). Accessing an index takes simple arithmetic.

2. O(n). Unshifting needs to rebuild the whole array.

3. O(n). Needs to pass through the entire string once.

4. O(2n). Needs to .pop the entire string, and then .push it.

5. O(n). Iterates through each item once.

6. O(n). Needs to check every item. Passes at least once.

7. O(n). Compare max with previous max; replace if necessary. 
         Needs to loop through at least once.
         
8. O(n). Has to iterate through once to find where to split.

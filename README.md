# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)
Accessing an item by index in an array
answer: O(n)
Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
answer: O(1) or O(n) creat a new array and then put the new item in the [0]position then
add the rest of them
Pushing an item onto the end of an array
O(1)
Upcasing a String
O(n) creat a new array and then paste each uppcase inside it
Reversing a String
O(n) creat a new array and then paste each word in a reverse way
The Enumerable#each method
each "each method" contains one O(n) loop if it's 2 then O(n^2)
The Enumerable#include? method
eumerate every elements O(n)
Finding the max of an array
O(n), enumerate every elements in an array, if it's already sorted , then O(log(n))
splitting a String
O(n) push every element into a new array
Inserting a value to a Hash
O(1) insert a key then a value attached to it, no concern about the data size
Retrieving the keys of a Hash ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
O(n) enumerate every key to see if the value matched

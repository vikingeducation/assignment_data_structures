# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

# Completed by Farruh
[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

# 1) Accessing an item by index in an array:
  It will take O(1) work. Time will be constant, no matter the size of array.

# 2) Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array:
  O(n) work, each item in array moves.

# 3) Pushing an item onto the end of an array
  O(1) work, simply adding an item to the end, doesn't require iteration through it.

# 4) Upcasing a String
  O(n), each letter will be changed.

# 5) Reversing a String
  O(n), order of each letter will be changed.

# 6) The Enumerable#each method
  O(n), iterates through each element.  

# 7) The Enumerable#include? method
  O(n), iterates through each element.  

# 8) Finding the max of an array
  O(n), iterates through each element.  

# 9) splitting a String
  O(n), iterates through each element.  

# 10) Inserting a value to a Hash
  O(1), doesn't require iteration.

# 11) Retrieving the keys of a Hash ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
  O(n), iterates through each element in Hash.
